# Rushbot
If you're reading this, you're probably a member of Cyberpunk Rush. Please DM me immediately if I fucked up and left any secrets in here - I'm too lazy to actually switch to using Github Secrets for all my variables lol

Anyway. It's a mess. It's also probably gonna stay that way. But, if anyone wants to contribute code, hit me up on discord (myriad2223) and I can add you as a contributor. I'll need to splice your commits in manually to the actual source code on my side because I'm not gonna actually host this thing via Github at this point in its lifespan, though.

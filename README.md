If you're reading this, you're probably a member of Cyberpunk Rush. Please DM me immediately if I fucked up and left any secrets in here - I'm too lazy to actually switch to using Github Secrets for all my variables lol

Anyway. It's a mess. It's also probably gonna stay that way. But, if anyone wants to contribute code, hit me up on discord (myriad2223) and I can add you as a contributor. I'll need to splice your commits in manually to the actual source code on my side because I'm not gonna actually host this thing via Github at this point in its lifespan, though.

All the source code is in those three python files. 
- Test.py has almost all of it.
- RandomHelpers.py has some functions that are used in Test.py. A remnant from a time where I was actually somewhat committed to separating my code.
- SheetUpdate.py is for World Team sheet updating functions. Godspeed on inferring how it works without having the sheet to refer to if you decide to take a look, even I get lost sometimes and I wrote the code XD
